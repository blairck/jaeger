### Description ###
Jaeger is a game for playing and analyzing games of Foxes & Geese. This is a 
port of a game I wrote originally in Objective-C in 2011. See:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_games

Project Status: Active

Note: I am unable to accept any pull requests at this time. If you would like 
to work on Jaeger, please fork it.

### Goals ###
* Port game playing engine from Objective-C to Python (in progress, see Status)
* Seperate UI logic from the rest of the game. Jaeger will have a minimalÂ text
interface for playing against the computer
* Thorough unit testing coverage
* Currently the algorithm is strictly minimax. Implement alpha-beta pruning.
* Analysis of completed games, and suggest alternative lines.

### Status ###
Functions to be ported and tested, organized by component
* AI                            0/11
* Connection                    5/5
* FileController                0/2
* GameInterface                 0/23
* GameNode                      7/7
* HistoryNode                   11/11
* Rules                         14/14
* TOTAL                         37/73

### Requirements ###
To use:
* Python 3.5

### Setting Up ###
In the root folder of the project do the following:
```
virtualenv env
pip install -r requirements.txt
. env/bin/activate
make status
```
The status command will run PyLint over code in the src folder and then (if no
lint issues are found) execute all unittest files in the test folder.

### Todo ###
* See: https://github.com/blairck/jaeger/issues
